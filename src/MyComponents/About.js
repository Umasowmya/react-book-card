      On Dec 29, 2020, I had a little reunion with my college friends and my former professor
       in a zoom meeting. My former professor is Dicky Arinal, and he is working for Disney+ now. 
       The reunion reminded me of when Pak Dicky(We called him using Pak in Indonesia) showed off 
       one of his magics using Emmet, and it made me amazed. However, at that time we were still using
        Visual Studio because he taught ASP.NET, and we needed to install Web Essentials for using Zen Coding, 
        which is the former name of Emmet.
